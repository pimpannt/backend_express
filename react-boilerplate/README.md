# Chapter 1: Tree of Life   
- Express.js to make server
- Webpack

# Chapter 2: Twilight Ozone
- Babel
    Because React emrace JSX, Babel helps compile JSX syntax to JS.We can now use the ES6 syntax and Babel will compile that to its equivalent ES5 form.
    - @babel/core (To transform ES6+ code to ES5)
    - @babel/preset-env (Preset to allow polyfills)
    - @babel/preset-react (Preset for React and JSX)
    - babel-loader (Webpack helper)
- Babel + Webpack
    Based on Babel's functionality, Webpack needs to know that .js and .jsx files need to go through Babel before being bundled.So, we need to configure Webpack for that rule. 

# Chapter 3: Utopia
- React + ReactDOM
- React + Webpack
    we need to tell Webpack what to do with the new .html file. Webpack needs to bundle it to the dist folder.
- React Express

    - sass-loader
